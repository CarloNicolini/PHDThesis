Brain networks are intrinsically weighted with weights reflecting a continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different regions.
A fundamental limitation of Surprise lies in its definition in terms of discrete probability and binomial coefficients that make it applicable only to binary networks, i.e.
graphs with edge values $1$ or $0$.
For this reason, Surprise requires binarization of brain connectivity networks, a process that may discard potentially relevant information contained in the edge weights distribution.
Moreover, different binarization procedures may lead to different network representations for the same connectivity dataset.
This represents a substantial drawback of the binary Surprise approach.

The results obtained from binary Surprise optimization on real functional connectivity networks encouraged me to extend the Surprise optimization approach to weighted networks. 
Capitalizing on recent developments in the field of statistical physics of complex networks, here I show that binary Surprise can be extended to weighted networks.
This recently introduced approach dubbed Asymptotical Surprise provides a new and valuable tool to study the modular organization of brain connectivity beyond the resolution limit.
Furthermore, I will present a new algorithm for the direct optimization of Asymptotical Surprise that is based on the previously described FAGSO method.

Improved resolution afforded by Asymptotical Surprise may imply increased vulnerability to spurious modules resulting from noisy correlations.
It is therefore important to assess the benefits of increased resolution against the limitations arising from intrinsic data variability.
To this end, I will demonstrate this new approach in networks derived from synthetic datasets that mimic different structures, levels of noise and variability, like those observed in functional connectivity experimental data.

Finally, I will apply Asymptotical Surprise optimization to weighted functional connectivity networks from real-world resting state fMRI data, revealing a heterogeneous, multiscale community structure.
The finer modular subdivision of resting state functional connectivity networks obtained by Asymptotical Surprise optimization leads to substantial differences in the identification of connector hubs compared to other community detection methods.

\section{From Surprise to Asymptotical Surprise}
In developing a quality function inspired by the principle of Surprise that works for weighted networks, it is convenient to consider the asymptotical expansion of the hypergeometric distribution.
Hereafter I will stick to the derivation obtained by Traag~\cite{traag2015}.
One can introduce $q=m_\zeta/m$ and $\left<q \right>=p_\zeta/p$ as the observed and expected fraction of intracluster edges.
By only taking into account the dominant term of the sum in Eq.~\ref{eq:surprise} (the one with $i=m_\zeta$), after some manipulations one gets an approximate expression for the logarithmic Surprise\footnote{If not specified, starting from here we use natural base logarithms.}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surprise_dominant}
\log(S) \approx \log \left( \frac{\binom{\left<q\right> p}{m_\zeta} \binom{(1-\left<q\right>)p}{m(1-q)}}{\binom{p}{m}} \right)
\end{equation}
which corresponds to the probability of observing exactly $m_\zeta$ internal links, given the clustering $\zeta$.
As the denominator in Eq.~\ref{eq:surprise_dominant} is independent of the partition, it can be discarded, and, thanks to the Stirling approximation of the binomial coefficients, which reads 
\begin{equation}
\log \binom{n}{k} \approx k \log \left( \frac{n}{k} \right)
\end{equation}
one can write the dominant term~\ref{eq:surprise_dominant} as:
\begin{equation}
\log(S) = - \log \left(\frac{m}{p}\right)^{-m} \left[ \left(\frac{\left< q\right>}{q}\right)^q \left(\frac{1-\left< q\right>}{1-q}\right)^{1-q} \right]^{m}
\end{equation}
The term $(m/p)^{-m}$ is also independent of the partition and can be ignored.
Hence, the asymptotic expansion of Surprise reads:
\begin{equation}
\log(S) = -m \left[ q \log \frac{\left<q\right>}{q} + (1-q)\log \frac{1-\left<q\right>}{1-q} \right]
\end{equation}
Interestingly, this last equation corresponds to the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence $m D_{KL}(q \| \left< q \right>)$, which is interpretable as the distance between the two probability distributions $q$ and $\left<q\right>$.
More precisely, it is the information lost when one encodes the distribution $q$ with the distribution $\left< q\right>$.
Thus, in the limit of large networks, Surprise $\hat{S}$ can be approximated by a binomial distribution.
This observation led to definition of Asymptotical Surprise $\mathcal{S}_a$~\cite{traag2015}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:asymptoticalsurprise}
\mathcal{S}_a = m D_{\textrm{KL}}\left( q \| \left< q \right> \right)
\end{equation}
where the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence~\cite{kullback1951,cover2006} is $$D_{\textrm{KL}}(x\|| y) = x \log \left(\frac{x}{y} \right) + (1-x)\log \left (\frac{1-x}{1-y} \right).$$

In the framework of information theory~\cite{cover2006}, Asymptotical Surprise represents the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the observed and expected fraction of intra-cluster edges; it encodes the information lost when the prior distribution $\left <q \right >$ is used to approximate the posterior distribution $q$.
Kullback-Leibler divergence is a quasi-distance on probability distributions as it is always non-negative, non-symmetric and zero only when $q=\left< q \right>$, exactly like binary Surprise.

Asymptotical Surprise has a simpler formulation than binary Surprise as there are no binomial coefficients to evaluate and it has been shown to be resolution-limit-free in the limit of large networks~\cite{traag2015}.
As a side effect of its definition in terms of an information-theoretic quantity, Asymptotical Surprise transparently allows the extension to weighted networks, when the intracluster number of edges is replaced by the sum of intracluster weights.
This powerful property made Asymptotical Surprise suited for community detection in weighted networks and in particular to brain functional connectivity networks, thus avoiding the need of binarization procedures prior to the community detection, as shown in~\cite{nicolini2017}.

Given its information-theoretic formulation as a KL divergence, Asymptotical Surprise clearly features \emph{convexity}, a property that is more difficult to assess for binary Surprise.
Optimization of convex functions is typically simpler due to some regularities featured by such functions and the availability of practical algorithms.
Furthermore, a convex function guarantees a landscape with a global optimum and no degeneracy, a property that is extremely important for community detection.

Numerical evaluation of Asymptotical Surprise is much faster than binary Surprise. Furthermore, it approximates very well Surprise already for networks with more than 50 nodes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:asymptotical_surprise_comparison}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PACO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Maximization of Asymptotical Surprise: PACO}
Finding the optimal partition of a graph is an NP-hard problem~\cite{fortunato2010} and practical implementations of community detection rely on heuristic approaches that enable finding nearly optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time.

Here I introduce a powerful and general method for the optimization of Asymptotical Surprise dubbed PACO (PArtitioning Cost Optimization).
PACO is a non-deterministic agglomerative algorithm based on FAGSO (described in chapter~\ref{sec:max_surprise_fagso}) and, like the Louvain method, has an element of randomness that enables a more efficient exploration of the partition landscape.

The operating principle of PACO is based on the triadic closure property, i.e.
the fact that, in real-world networks, nodes with many common neighbors are more likely to be neighbors.
This transitive neighborhood property underlies the formation of communities of nodes~\cite{bianconi2014,eustace2015}.
In principle, any measure of structural similarity between nodes could guide a community detection heuristic toward the optimal partition.
Specifically, PACO uses the Jaccard index~\cite{jaccard1901}, a measure of the fraction of overlap between the neighbors in common between nodes, as the guiding principle for the agglomeration of similar nodes in the same community.

In the first phase of PACO, the Jaccard metric is evaluated for every edge.
More formally, for an edge $e=(u,v)$ the Jaccard index is computed as $J(e)=\frac{|\Gamma(u) \cap \Gamma(v)|}{|\Gamma(u) \cup \Gamma(v)|}$ where $\Gamma(u)$ and $\Gamma(v)$ are the neighboring nodes of $u$ and $v$ respectively.

The agglomerative process starts with an initial partition where every vertex represents a community on its own.
This partition has $n$ communities and no intra-cluster edges.
The edges of the graph are then ranked in decreasing order by their Jaccard index and iteratively, for every edge in the sorted list, endpoint nodes are merged only if they belong to different communities.
In this case, one of the two endpoints, selected by chance, is assigned to the other's endpoint community and the increment of Surprise is computed: if it is positive, the partition is updated together with the new value of Surprise (or Asymptotical Surprise), otherwise the algorithm proceeds to the next edge.


Algorithm~\ref{algo:paco} describes the details of PACO for Surprise and Asymptotical Surprise Optimization.
The function \textsc{Paco} takes as input a graph G and returns the nodes community membership vector $C$.
Line 1 initializes the value of Surprise to 0.
Line 2 assign to each node in the graph its community.
Line 3 creates a list of edges $E'$ sorted in decreasing order by their Jaccard coefficient.
Line 4 iterates on every edge $e=(u,v)$ and at line 6 checks if the endpoints they share the same community.
Line 8 copies the membership vector to a temporary vector $C'$.
Lines 9-13 choose randomly at chance if to put node u in the community of v or viceversa.
Line 14 computes the new value of Surprise $S'$ from the just updated community membership $C$.
The function \textsc{ComputeSurprise} returns the value of Surprise for graph $G$ and partition $C$.
Lines 15 to 18 checks if the new value of Surprise $S'$ is greater than the previously stored value S and update Surprise and the membership vector, otherwise continue to the next edge.
Line 19 returns the final community membership assignment.
The implementation of PACO in \texttt{C++}, \texttt{Python} and \texttt{GNU Octave} is available upon request \url{http://forms.iit.it/view.php?id=68447}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% RUNNING TIME ANALYSIS OF PACO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Running time analysis of PACO}
I applied PACO on a full-resolution voxelwise connectivity matrix with 51,653 nodes and almost 2 million edges.
PACO took 14 minutes for a single repetition on a server with Intel Xeon E5-2643@ 3.40 Ghz CPU and 256 GB ram.
I estimated that 2000 repetitions of PACO would take approximately 2.5 weeks on this server.
I have also tried to run PACO on a standard office PC with 16 GB memory and an Intel Core i7: it took almost 40 minutes.
It is important to notice that the running time of PACO is mainly determined by the computation of Jaccard indexes in the initial step.
The running time for this computation is in the order of $O(n\langle k \rangle^2)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\langle k \rangle$ is the average degree of nodes.
On a desktop workstation with a 2.5 GHz CPU, PACO runs in some tenths of seconds on a single repetition for a graph of around 600 nodes with a density close to 10\%, typical of brain networks.
A small benchmark of PACO running time on a desktop workstation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:paco_benchmark}, where I found optimal Surprise partitions of a LFR network with the parameters described in the text but increasing number of nodes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% PACO REPRODUCIBILITY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reproducibility of PACO optimal solutions}
To get a better idea of how fast the PACO method converges to a maximum, I have plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:paco_variability} the optimal value of Asymptotical Surprise over the 10000 runs for one instance of the LFR network, and for the resting state data-set presented in the section~\ref{sec:restingstatedataset}.
From these graphs, it appears that 2000 runs may be sufficient to reach stable community detection for the experimental data-set.
A near-optimum value is reached earlier for the LFR network, but it should be noted that I have taken an instance of the synthetic network with no-noise added.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BENCHMARKING PACO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Benchmarking PACO}
Two of the most important parameters to shape the community structure of an LFR network are the topological and mixing coefficients (see section~\ref{sec:sbm}).
The topological mixing coefficient $\mu_t$ is the average ratio of intra-cluster neighbors divided by the number of inter-cluster neighbors, as defined in~\cite{lancichinetti2008}.
The weights mixing coefficient is defined as the average ratio of node intra-cluster strength and inter-cluster strength, as defined in~\cite{lancichinetti2009a}.
I explored the effects of these parameters on the ability of PACO to retrieve the planted structure in the network.
I set $\mu_t=\mu_w$, as setting $\mu_w$ greater than $\mu_t$ would introduce inconsistency in the relative number and weight of the edges, with intermodule edges carrying the largest weights.
I analyzed the performance of Newman's Modularity, Infomap and PACO on LFR networks when varying topological and weights mixing coefficients.
Figure~\ref{fig:avgmutmuw} shows that the performance of the three methods is comparable in terms of NMI, with a faster decay of NMI for InfoMap and Newman compared to PACO for large $\mu_t$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DEGENERACY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Degeneracy of Asymptotical Surprise}\label{sec:degeneracy_asymptotical_surprise}
Degeneracy of nearly-optimal solutions, whereby similar values of the fitness function around its maximum correspond to substantially different partitions, has been observed for Newman's Modularity~\cite{good2009}.
A consensus approach has been suggested in~\cite{lancichinetti2012} as a means to mitigate the degeneracy problem, yielding a stable ``average'' solution over a large set of partitions.
In order to ascertain whether Asymptotical Surprise suffers from a similar shortcoming I have performed degeneracy analysis by following~\cite{good2009}, for Newman's Modularity.
In created a benchmark network consisting of 24 cliques of 5 nodes, connected by a single link to form a connected ring-like structure.
I sampled the configuration space of partitions during iterative steps of PACO optimization starting from different random solutions and annotating the corresponding values of Asymptotical Surprise for each partition.
Afterward, I embedded the similarity matrix between all sampled partitions into a three-dimensional space maintaining similarity relations between partition with a Curvilinear Components Analysis (CCA)~\cite{good2009}.
In the embedded manifold, two partitions are close if they are similar and the z-axis encodes the quality function.
Whereas a broad plateau of solutions with similar values of maximum Modularity is observed as in Figure~\ref{fig:degeneracylandscape}A, consistent with~\cite{good2009}, Asymptotical Surprise displays a much sharper peak corresponding to the optimal solution, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:degeneracy_asymptotical_surprise}.
The existence of a globally maximum partition that is much different from the other suboptimal solutions indicates that there is no need to resort on consensus-based approaches for the identification of the best candidate solution, as picking the highest Asymptotical Surprise value already yields the correct partition.

Red points represent individual partitions and their metric distance is proportional to their NMI, the closer the points, the more similar the partitions.}

%%%%%%%%%% SYNTHETIC BENCHMARK NETWORKS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Synthetic benchmark networks}
One important finding in~\cite{nicolini2016} is that brain networks are organized in modules with a heterogeneous size distribution.
I implemented this property in our two types of benchmark networks.
For the first test, I generated a ring of cliques with $300$ nodes, and sizes of the cliques sampled from a power-law with exponent $\tau_c=2$, minimum and maximum clique size respectively $\min_c=5$, $\max_c=50$.
For each subject of the sample, I synthesized $150$ time-points for each node using the \texttt{neuRosim R} package~\cite{neurosim2011}.
I set the baseline value of all the time series to $100$~\cite{welvaert2013}.

Finally, I correlated the original synthetic time series $\mathbf{X}$ by multiplication with the matrix $\mathbf{L}$, obtained the correlated time series $\mathbf{Y}$ and added Rician noise~\cite{Gudbjartsson1995} to $\mathbf{Y}$ independently for each area.
The simulated data $\mathbf{Y}$ did not include slow drift components, simulated physiological noise, nor spatial noise.
The average SNR is defined as $\textsc{SNR}=\bar{S}/\sigma_N$ where $\bar{S}$ is the average magnitude of the signal and $\sigma_N$ is the standard deviation of the noise~\cite{kruger2011}.

To be more exhaustive and extend the validity of results, I repeated the same procedure on weighted LFR networks with $N=600$ nodes, sampling nodes degree from a power-law with exponent $\tau_d=2$, average degree $\left<k\right>=12$ and maximum degree $\max_k=50$.
I set the topological and weights mixing coefficients, i.e.
the average fraction of intra-cluster and inter-cluster degree and strengths, to $\mu_t=0.1$ and $\mu_w=0.1$, respectively.
Planted community sizes ranged from $5$ to $50$ nodes and were sampled from a power law with exponent $\tau_c=1$.
Figure~\ref{fig:lfrringclique} shows two realizations of these models.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/pacopaperfigure1.pdf}
\caption{The two benchmark networks used in this study, laid out.

The layout of (B) was generated with the graph-tool library~\cite{peixoto_graph_tool_2014}.}
\label{fig:lfrringclique}
\end{figure}

Group-level correlation matrices were computed by Fisher-transforming and averaging individual instances of the above matrices.
Sparsification was obtained by removing edges with weights below the most stringent threshold that maintained the network connectedness, a procedure known as percolation analysis~\cite{gallos2012,bardella2016a,alexander-bloch2010}.
This approach measures the size of the largest connected component of the network upon iterative removal of the weakest edges and enables data-driven determination of the optimal sparsification threshold that preserves network structure and connectedness while removing potentially spurious correlations.

The community structure of the resulting weighted sparsified matrices was detected by Asymptotical Surprise optimized with PACO and compared against two widely used methods, Infomap~\cite{rosvall2008} and Newman's Modularity~\cite{blondel2008,newman2006}, that are affected by the resolution limit, albeit to different extents.
In Newman's Modularity, the size of the smallest detectable cluster is of the order of the square root of the number of edges in the entire network~\cite{fortunato2007}, while Infomap has a limit that depends on the overall number of inter-cluster edges~\cite{kawamoto2015}.
Here I used the Louvain implementation available in the Brain Connectivity toolbox~\cite{rubinov2010} and the Infomap implementation available in the \texttt{igraph-0.7.1} package~\cite{igraph2006}.

For all methods, including PACO, I launched $10,000$ independent runs and picked the membership corresponding to the partition with the best value of the fitness function, the maximum for Modularity and Asymptotical Surprise, the minimum for Infomap.
As discussed in the previous chapter, sections~\ref{sec:degeneracy},~\ref{sec:degeneracy_surprise},~\ref{sec:degeneracy_asymptotical_surprise}, degeneracy of nearly-optimal solutions does not appear to severely affect Surprise or Asymptotical Surprise, and a consensus approach is not deemed necessary for these functions.
This analysis supports the choice of selecting the solution with the highest value of the fitness function.

%%%%%%%%  PACO BENCHMARK ON SYNTHETIC NETWORKS %%%%%%%%

\section{PACO benchmark on synthetic networks}
I compared the quality of the partitions of the synthetic benchmark networks obtained by Asymptotical Surprise with those of Infomap~\cite{rosvall2008} and Newman's Modularity~\cite{newman2006,blondel2008}.
Figure~\ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}A shows Normalized Mutual Information, Sensitivity and Specificity of the three methods applied to the ring of cliques for different sample sizes and SNRs; the no-noise condition is represented as ``Inf''.
This model network was constructed to test the ability of the three methods to retrieve heterogeneous community structures under various noise conditions.

As expected, all methods showed better performance with increasing SNR and number of subjects, as noise and intersubject variability introduce spurious edges that hinder the ability to retrieve the planted structure.
Partitions obtained with Newman's modularity showed the lowest NMI with respect to the planted partition under all conditions.
Sensitivity of Newman's modularity did not exceed $0.75$ even for high SNRs and a large number of subjects, a consequence of its stronger resolution limit.
For this network, Infomap performed substantially better in terms of NMI against the planted partition, with a Sensitivity that was superior to that of Modularity across the spectrum of conditions.

Asymptotical Surprise showed highest NMI and Sensitivity across conditions, consistent with its resolution-limit-free behavior.
It proved superior in terms of NMI and Sensitivity in the low SNR regimes, and in the presence of relatively large intersubject variability as mimicked by the generation of different instances of the ring of cliques.
Specificity of Asymptotical Surprise was not inferior to the other methods under all conditions, thus ruling out increased vulnerability to False Positives, at least in this particular model network.

Comparable results were obtained for the LFR network (Figure~\ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}B), a model graph that replicates the distribution of nodal degree observed in many real-world networks, including those representing functional brain connectivity.
All three methods showed similar values of NMI for high SNR and a large number of subjects, with a plateau reaching maximum Sensitivity with a group sample bigger than $20$ and SNR above $30$.
Sensitivity was only slightly worse for Modularity, but it should be noted that for the LFR network the size distribution of the planted modules was narrower than for the ring of cliques, thus making the resolution limit less evident.

In the lower SNR regime, Asymptotical Surprise presented the best performance in terms of NMI and Sensitivity, with a slower decay for decreasing SNR.

Specificity was almost equivalent across the three methods, with a quick convergence to the maximum value of 1 for high SNR and good performance (around $0.97$) for low SNR.
Asymptotical Surprise presented a faster decay with decreasing SNR.
However, it should be noticed that the scale of Specificity has a very narrow range ($0.97$-$1.00$), and the differences between the three methods were relatively small.

Consensus analysis applied to Newman's Modularity to assess the potential effects of the degeneracy of nearly optimal solutions did not show substantial differences in the comparison with the other methods.
Notably, Infomap showed a large variability in Accuracy for lower SNRs and number of subjects.
Under closer examination, however, it appeared that the increased variance for Infomap was due to occasional runs in which the algorithm only retrieved one or two large modules.
This is a known problem with Infomap (and other algorithms based on random walks) that depends on the need to parametrize the teleportation step in order to make the dynamics ergodic~\cite{lambiotte2012}.

For the sake of completeness, I also computed Accuracy and Matthew Correlation Coefficient for the same model networks.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accmcc}A, Accuracy of Newman's Modularity is lower for small SNRs and number of subjects and in any case it does not reach 100\% of true positives classification even in the no-noise condition.
Infomap accuracy is high for SNR greater than 20, largely independent on the number of subjects.
The large variance of Infomap for low SNRs is due to the merging of all nodes in a single large community in a few runs, as discussed in the main text.
Asymptotical Surprise, behaves well in terms of Accuracy and has the least variability across all methods, plateauing at 100\% for SNRs greater than 20 and more than 40 subjects.
In terms of MCC, Figure~\ref{fig:accmcc}A shows that Asymptotical Surprise behaves comparably or better than Infomap.
Newman's modularity is the least performer, due to its resolution limit, and never reaches maximum MCC.
Interestingly, Asymptotical Surprise slightly outperforms Infomap regarding MCC in the single subject case in the no-noise condition.
The comparison of the three methods is similar in the case of the LFR benchmark, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accmcc}B.
Altogether, the picture that emerges from the analysis of Accuracy and MCC is entirely consistent with the results shown in this section.

\section{Asymptotical Surprise on resting state dataset}
Figure~\ref{fig:partitioncomparison} shows a comparison between the modular structure of the resting state fMRI dataset obtained with Newman's Modularity, Infomap and Asymptotical Surprise.
For each method, I had $10,000$ independent runs and picked the partition with the best value of the respective fitness functions ($Q=0.4967$, $\mathcal{L}=8.5173$, $S_a=5925.3$, for Modularity, Infomap and Asymptotical Surprise, respectively).
The three methods showed significantly different partitions (relative NMIs in Table 1), with a number of detected communities of 10, 19 and 47 for Modularity, Infomap and Asymptotical Surprise, respectively.
Interestingly, Modularity detected a relatively uniform size distribution, consistent with the intrinsic scale built into the fitness function.
Infomap showed a wider distribution of module sizes, with number of nodes ranging between 156 and 3, while Surprise showed the largest spread, and included communities as small as single nodes (singletons).

Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4} shows the 16 largest modules detected by Asymptotical Surprise, ranked by the number of nodes comprised in each community.

The first and largest module (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}A) includes the pre- and post-central gyri, part of the supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area.
The second community (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}B) consists largely of nodes belonging to the occipital lobe: the visual areas and the surrounding calcarine sulcus, the lingual and fusiform gyrus.
The third module (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}C) reflects the Default Mode Network, spanning the temporoparietal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate/precuneus.
The nodes involved in the executive frontal functions form the fourth largest community.
Interestingly, nodes in the communities D, E, G are the major players that take part in the so-called frontoparietal attentional network~\cite{markett2014}.
The auditory network, comprising temporal areas, was detected as a distinct community (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}F).
Deeper structures emerge as separate modules in Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}H, with subcortical areas including the basal ganglia, i.e.
putamen, globum pallidum, caudate nucleus and the whole thalamus.
The hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus were identified as separate communities (O and P).
Additional, smaller substructures are shown in the third and fourth row of Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}, including the Supplementary Motor Area (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}J) and the orbital (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}M) and orbitofrontal (Figure~\ref{fig:cervellini4x4}I) modules, containing nodes from Brodmann area 47.

Newman's Modularity retrieved four large, relatively uniform communities, corresponding to the Default Mode Network, the central network, occipital and frontoparietal networks.
This is in keeping with previous studies using Modularity optimization by spectral decomposition~\cite{crossley2013a}, and consistent with the strong resolution limit that affects this method.
Additionally, a few smaller modules were found by Louvain optimization of Newman's Modularity, corresponding to the basal ganglia, the hippocampal/parahippocampal formation, and two asymmetrically distributed subcortical clusters.

Infomap identified 19 communities of various sizes, also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:infomapcervellini}.
The largest modules showed a close correspondence with those identified by Asymptotical Surprise, albeit with some notable differences.
By way of example, the largest component includes the motor-sensory and auditory modules, identified as separate communities by Asymptotical Surprise.
The Default Mode Network retrieved by Infomap includes parts of the temporal cortices that are not normally associated with the DMN.
Similarly, hippocampus and the parahippocampal modules were merged by Infomap and resolved as individual modules by Asymptotical Surprise.
Other modules, including the visual, associative and executive networks (C, E and F in Figure~\ref{fig:infomapcervellini}, respectively) were qualitatively very similar to those identified by Asymptotical Surprise.

Altogether, the picture that emerges is consistent with the idea that the resolution limit is more severe in Newman's Modularity than in Infomap, and that Asymptotical Surprise presents the best resolving power among the three methods in a real-world network with finite SNR and variability as the resting state functional connectivity network used for this study.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HUB CLASSIFICATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hub classification}
Maps of the anatomical distribution of the participation coefficient and within-module degree show substantial differences between the three community detection methods (Figure~\ref{fig:hubclassification}), resulting in discrepancies in the identification of the connector hubs for the same functional connectivity network.

Figure~\ref{fig:hubclassification_threshold} shows the nodes with simultaneously high values of participation coefficient and within-module degree (connector hubs, according to the Guimera and Amaral's classification).
All three methods pinpoint connector hubs in the superior, superior medial and middle frontal areas, as well as in the supplementary motor area.
However, substantial differences are observed for other hub regions.
The partition of Asymptotical Surprise localizes connector hubs in the Temporal Middle and Frontal Middle gyri, as well as in the Rectus, Middle Cingulate Cortex, Lingual gyrus and in the Precuneus.

Community detection by InfoMap results in the identification of hubs that are partially consistent with either of the two other methods, in keeping with the idea that its resolution limit is less severe than for Newman's Modularity.
Altogether, these findings indicate that node role classification is method-dependent, and may be affected by the resolution limit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% VALIDATION OF ASYMPTOTICAL SURPRISE IN MODEL NETWORKS %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Validation of Asymptotical Surprise in model networks}
The performance of Asymptotical Surprise optimization by PACO was assessed in model graphs with a built-in community structure, and compared with two established community detection methods.
I have chosen two synthetic benchmark networks, the ring of cliques and the LFR network.

The ring of cliques presents a clear-cut modular structure by construct, with modules corresponding to complete subgraphs of variable sizes sampled from a power-law distribution.

This toy network proved useful to assess the effects of the resolution limit in the presence of a wide distribution of cluster sizes.
The effects of this limit were particularly apparent for Newman's Modularity (Figure~\ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}A), that showed poor Sensitivity even for noiseless rings of cliques, plateauing at a value of $0.75$.
This is consistent with the findings of~\cite{fortunato2007}, which showed that for Modularity the resolution limit is set by the square root of the total number of edges in the graph.
For Infomap, this limit is less severe and is determined by the number of inter-cluster edges~\cite{kawamoto2015}.
Accordingly, the effects of the resolution limit were not apparent in this model network, where modules are sparingly connected by single edges.
Asymptotical Surprise presented the best performance, consistent with the idea that this cost function is quasi-resolution limit free~\cite{traag2015}.

However, real brain networks are characterized by heterogeneous distributions of node degree, with fat tails and power-law decays~\cite{bullmore2009}.
Such heterogeneity is critical, as it determines some of the remarkable features of brain connectivity networks, including resilience to random failure and rich-clubness~\cite{vandenheuvel2011,vandenheuvel2013a}.
To provide a more realistic benchmark, I used the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi algorithm~\cite{lancichinetti2008}, which made it possible to generate networks with realistic and tunable power law degree distribution and community sizes.

For LFR networks, the difference in performance in the low-noise regime was more nuanced for the three methods compared in this study, possibly a result of a fuzzier community structure of the LFR network compared to the ring of cliques, and of the narrower distribution of cluster sizes.
However, the picture appeared different when noise and intersubject variability were injected into the network structure.

Noise and other sources of variability in the data can significantly affect the structure of the resulting network representation.
Noisy fMRI time-courses, for example, may introduce spurious correlations in brain functional connectivity networks.
This problem may be particularly relevant for methods endowed with high resolution, like Asymptotical Surprise, that may be more vulnerable to False Positives generated by the misassignment of peripheral nodes, particularly in small clusters.
Hence, the resolving power of community detection methods should be gauged against Specificity, which may be affected by noise in the distribution of edges that define the network's structure.
However, to the best of our knowledge, this aspect has never been considered in the existing literature assessing the performance of community detection algorithms as applied to the study of brain connectivity.

To this end, I have devised methods to inject noise, with amplitude and spectral distribution that mimic those of experimental noise, into networks with a well defined planted structure.
Moreover, I have generated different instances for each network, corresponding to different subjects in a group, to account for intersubject variability that occurs in typical neuroimaging studies.

Unsurprisingly, for all methods and networks, detection of the planted structure improved with decreasing levels of noise, and with increasing number of subjects in the study.
However, Asymptotical Surprise appeared to provide a superior performance in terms of NMI and Sensitivity to the planted structure for lower SNRs in both types of networks, while its Specificity was in line with that of resolution-limited methods like Newman's and Infomap (Figures~\ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}A,~\ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}B).
This rules out the idea that the higher sensitivity to small clusters of Asymptotical Surprise may be detrimental in noisy networks, making it more vulnerable to small, spurious modules.

\subsection{Asymptotical Surprise optimization on resting state networks}
Application of Asymptotical Surprise maximization to a group-level, resting state functional connectivity network from the brains of $27$ healthy subjects revealed a heterogeneous distribution of modules, with large and small modules coexisting in the optimal partition.
This is in keeping with previous findings with binary Surprise~\cite{nicolini2016}.
These modules closely reflect functional networks reported in many studies using Independent Component Analysis or other multivariate methods, including the sensorimotor, visual, default mode, executive, and attentional networks.
Moreover, anatomically defined subcortical structures, like the hippocampus and parahippocampal formations emerged as independent modules.

While this is entirely consistent with our understanding of the neurofunctional and anatomical organization of the human brain, the accuracy of Asymptotical Surprise in identifying these networks is notable.
Indeed, Surprise, like other graph-based community detection methods, divides networks into disjoint clusters of nodes on the basis of topological criteria.
While a correspondence between topological modularity and functional networks identified by, e.g.
Independent Component Analysis, may be expected, it is not a given, for they are defined on different principles.
Indeed, multivariate methods like ICA separate components on the basis of the statistical independence of the time-courses, and do not convey information regarding the mutual relationship between modules nor about their topological organization.

Previous studies applying resolution-limited methods like Newman's Modularity to the same dataset hereby analyzed~\cite{crossley2013a} found a few, large modules encompassing large-scale networks, but failed to identify finer, neurofunctionally plausible substructures like those shown in the present study.
Infomap, on the other hand, proved sensitive to heterogeneously distributed clusters, thus implying that this method does not have an intrinsic scale, like Modularity and variations thereof based on the introduction of a resolution parameter.

However, Asymptotical Surprise appears to provide superior performance in identifying small subnetworks, particularly in the presence of noise, thus suggesting that this method may represent a new standard for community detection in brain networks.
It should also be noted that no symmetry constraint was imposed, and the symmetrical bilateral distribution of nodes in the retrieved modules arises entirely from Asymptotical Surprise optimization.


Hierarchical clustering methods have been extensively applied to investigate the structure of brain connectivity networks, showing smaller and smaller clusters as the modules are iteratively subdivided~\cite{meunier2010}.
Maximization of Asymptotical Surprise reflects the optimal cut through the dendrogram representing connectivity at these different levels of subdivision and provides information on the optimal partition of the network.
Hence, the heterogeneous distribution of cluster sizes retrieved by Asymptotical Surprise suggests that multiple scales of structure exist at the same level of the dendrogram.

Finally, abnormal functional connectivity has been observed in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases, but the coarse resolution of methods like Newman's Modularity~\cite{fornito2015} may not have detected differences in the modular organization of networks in patients compared to healthy controls.
The improved resolution and sensitivity to multiscale structure afforded by Asymptotical Surprise may provide a powerful means to assess the brain functional architecture in disease states, thus contributing a potential imaging-based marker and a key to interpret the functional effects of aberrant connectivity.
\subsection{Hub classification}
The presence of heterogeneously distributed modules in functional connectivity networks may have important consequences for our understanding of the brain functional organization.
By way of example, it has been shown that highly connected nodes, or hubs, are critically important in brain connectivity networks, and may play different roles depending on their position and connectivity distribution within and between modules~\cite{bullmore2009}.
Hubs that primarily connect to nodes within the same community are dubbed “provincial hubs”, and are thought to be responsible for the definition and stability of the modules.
Conversely, hubs that connect different modules are referred to as “connector hubs” and ensure integration of the activity of the network.
The classification of hubs strongly depends on the modular structure that is considered, and inaccurate partitioning due to the resolution limit can lead to the wrong interpretation of their role in the interplay between segregation and integration of brain function~\cite{bullmore2009}.
The present study suggests that this may have been the case in previous studies, in which resolution limited methods characterized by an intrinsic scale have been used, and provides a solution that may enable more accurate classification of hubs and nodes.

The connector hubs identified by our three methods (Asymptotical Surprise, InfoMap and Newman) present some substantial differences, consistent with the idea that hub classification depends on community structure.
These differences are particularly interesting in the light of the important role that connector hubs are thought to play in integrating information flow through the brain, and their putative role in brain disease \cite{crossley2014,stam2014}.
By way of example, the Precuneus and the Cingulate Cortex are highlighted by Asymptotical Surprise, but not by Newman's Modularity, as connector hubs.
These are two key elements of the Default Mode Network that have been consistently identified as vulnerable regions in neurological diseases~\cite{vandenheuvel2013a,buckner2009}.

Community detection by resolution limited free methods should enable more accurate classification of hub nodes, and improve our understanding of their role in brain disease.

%%%%%%% LIMITATIONS OF ASYMPTOTICAL SURPRISE %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Limitations of Asymptotical Surprise}
Some caution should be taken in the interpretation of the graphs in Figures \ref{fig:nmisensitivityspecificity}A,B.
Indeed, the SNRs of the synthetic networks I have generated, reflect noise with features, like a Rician distribution, that mimic some, but not all aspects of the variability of experimental data.
By way of example, the brain parcellation scheme applied to define the nodes, and the heterogeneity of voxels within these parcels may play a role that is hard to model in toy networks~\cite{fornito2010}.
Hence, the simulated Sensitivity and Specificity as a function of SNR and number of subjects should not be taken as absolute values to be used in the power and sample size estimation in real experimental designs.
Nevertheless, these simulations provide useful information on the dependence of these parameters on noise levels, and a rigorous means to assess the relative merits of different community detection methods.

Finally, I should note that the maximum value of Asymptotical Surprise calculated with PACO is an index of quality of the entire partition, and not of individual modules.
Hence, individual modules may not all have the same strength of internal cohesiveness relative to their connection with other modules.
We have found hints of this phenomenon in the comparison of nearly-optimal partitions obtained in the $10,000$ runs of PACO that I have performed to find the optimal community structure for this network.
The overall community structure appeared to be robust, with most modules persistently emerging in every nearly-optimal partition, but in some cases pairs of modules split or merge in otherwise similar solutions.
Most notably, this was observed for the thalamus that in some instances was merged with the basal cluster and in others, featured as a separate module.
This phenomenon may be less critical for methods like Newman's Modularity that have an intrinsic scale and retrieve uniformly distributed modules.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CONCLUSIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
I have extended the use of Surprise, a resolution-limit-free fitness function for the study of the modular structure of complex networks, to weighted brain functional connectivity networks.
Specifically, I have developed a novel method, dubbed PACO, for the optimization of Asymptotical Surprise, a weighted counterpart of Surprise in the limit of large networks.
I have applied PACO optimization of Asymptotical Surprise in synthetic networks to evaluate the relative merits of this novel approach against Newman's Modularity and Infomap, two of the leading methods used for community detection in brain connectivity networks.

Specifically, I have implemented a process to inject noise into networks endowed with a ground-truth modular structure to assess the trade-off between improved resolution afforded by Asymptotical Surprise and potential sensitivity to spurious correlations introduced by variability in the data.
Asymptotical Surprise optimization proved superior to existing methods in terms of Sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of the planted structure as measured by Normalized Mutual Information, while showing comparable Specificity.

I have also applied this approach to the partitioning of functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experiments.
Direct comparison with other methods clearly demonstrated an improved capability to identify neurofunctionally plausible and anatomically well-defined substructures otherwise concealed by the resolution limit.
Asymptotical Surprise revealed a complex modular structure of resting state connectivity, with communities of widely different sizes reflecting distributed functional networks alongside with small, anatomically or functionally defined modules.

This evidence corroborates the idea that the resolution limit may have negatively affected current models of the brain modular organization and the identification of the hubs responsible for the integration of functional modules.
For this reason, the application of methods like Asymptotical Surprise provides a novel, powerful approach to study the modular structure of brain connectivity beyond this limit.
